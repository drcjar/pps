  abstract        = {Diagnosis of pleural plaques (PPs) is commonly straightforward, especially when a typical appearance is observed in a context of previous asbestos exposure. Nevertheless, numerous causes of focal pleural thickening may be seen in routine practice. They may be related to normal structures, functional pleural thickening, previous tuberculosis, pleural metastasis, silicosis or other rarer conditions. An application of a rigorous technical approach as well as a familiarity with loco-regional anatomy and the knowledge of typical aspects of PP are required. Indeed, false-positive or false-negative results may engender psychological and medico-legal consequences or can delay diagnosis of malignant pleural involvement. Correct recognition of PPs is crucial, as they may also be an independent risk factor for mortality from lung cancer in asbestos-exposed workers particularly in either smokers or former/ex-smokers. Finally, the presence of PP(s) may help in considering asbestosis as a cause of interstitial lung disease predominating in the subpleural area of the lower lobes. The aim of this pictorial essay is to provide a brief reminder of the normal anatomy of the pleura and its surroundings as well as the various aspects of PPs. Afterwards, the common pitfalls encountered in PP diagnosis will be emphasized and practical clues to differentiate actual plaque and pseudoplaque will be concisely described.},

  abstract        = {Most studies on asbestos-related diseases are based on chest radiographs, and dose-response relationships are still controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the most relevant parameters of asbestos exposure linked to pleural plaques and asbestosis diagnosed by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). A large screening programme including systematic HRCT examinations was organised from 2003 to 2005 in France for formerly asbestos-exposed workers. The time since first exposure (TSFE), level, duration and cumulative exposure to asbestos were used in adjusted unconditional logistic regression to model the relationships of the two diseases. Analysis of a population of 5,545 subjects demonstrated that TSFE (p<0.0001) and cumulative exposure (p = 0.02) (or level, depending on the models used), were independently associated with the frequency of pleural plaques. Only cumulative exposure (p<0.0001) or level of exposure (p = 0.02) were significantly associated with asbestosis. All trend tests were significant for these parameters. To date and to our knowledge, this study is the largest programme based on HRCT for the screening of asbestos-exposed subjects. Both time-response and dose-response relationships were demonstrated for pleural plaques, while only dose-response relationships were demonstrated for asbestosis. These parameters must be included in the definition of high-risk populations for HRCT-based screening programmes.},

It has been claimed that asbestosis is a necessary prerequisite for the malignancy, but epidemiologic studies usually do not have enough statistical strength to prove that asbestos-exposed patients without asbestosis are without risk. Several recent studies do actually indicate that there is a risk for such patients. In addition, case-referent studies of patients with lung cancer show an attributable risk for asbestos of 6% to 23%, which is much higher than the actual occurrence of asbestosis among these patients. Thus there is an increasing body of evidence that, at low exposure levels, asbestos produces a slight increase in the relative risk of lung cancer even in the absence of asbestosis. Consequently, all exposure to asbestos must be minimized.},

CT scans were carried out in 772 subjects. A questionnaire was employed to collect data on smoking habits and duration, peak and cumulative exposure, and time since first exposure to asbestos. Multiple logistic regression models with stepwise selection of variables were used to evaluate the associations. Fourteen (1.8%) cases of asbestosis, 187 (24.2%) of pleural plaques (PP), and 50 (6.5%) of diffuse pleural thickening (DPT) were found. The significant risk factors were: cumulative exposure for asbestosis (P for trend = 0.004); time since first exposure (P for trend <0.001), and peak exposure (P for trend <0.001) for PP; and time since first exposure for DPT (P for trend = 0.024). Parenchymal asbestosis and PP are associated with different aspects of asbestos exposure. DPT appears to be less specific for asbestos exposure.},

The use of spline functions with lifetime cumulative fiber exposure as a continuous variable showed that the odds of localized pleural thickening were significantly elevated at less than 1 f/cc-y. Odds of parenchymal abnormalities, restrictive spirometry, and chronic bronchitis were also significantly elevated at 108, 166, and 24 f/cc-y, respectively. The odds of several pulmonary health outcomes are correlated with cumulative exposure to Libby amphibole. That relatively low-lifetime cumulative exposures are associated with localized pleural thickening has implications for the non-cancer-risk assessment for Libby amphibole.},

These projections are based on the fit of a simple age and birth cohort model to male pleural cancer mortality from 1970 to 1989 for six countries (Britain, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands and Switzerland) which together account for three-quarters of the population of Western Europe. The model was tested by comparing observed and predicted numbers of deaths for the period 1990-94.
