\section*{Standard Operating Procedure for case and control recruitment and exposure assessment in the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Job Exposure Study (PPS)}

\tableofcontents

\section{Scope and applicability}

The purpose of this SOP is to describe the instructions for the enrolment of cases and controls, exposure assessment, and genetic testing in the PPS.

\section{Introduction}

The objective of PPS is to characterize and measure job exposures as an occupational determinant of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). This will be achieved through a case-control study in which historic job exposures are measured using a validated semi-structured interview. A blood test will also be obtained to investigate interaction between job exposures and IPF genetic susceptibility factors.   

\section{Recruitment}

\subsection{Recruitment of cases}

See figure ~\ref{fig:caserec}

Cases will be recruited from male patients with a new diagnosis of IPF made during the study period within the research network.

All clinic patients who meet the case inclusion criteria will be provided with a participant information sheet and participant job history sheet. Patients will be enrolled into the study, blood will be drawn, and a case-report form will be completed. The case-report form and blood samples will be placed into a pre-paid Royal Mail container and put in a postbox. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as part of enrolment. 

The central research team will be updated monthly with details of the number of eligible patients attending clinic, the number of eligible patients approached to participate in the study, and the number of patients agreeing to participate in the study.

Recruitment of cases from a centre stops when the agreed centre target is met or the agreed centre recruitment period ends.

\caption{Case recruitment\label{fig:caserec}}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Recruitment of controls}

See figure ~\ref{fig:contrec}

 Controls will be recruited from male patients with a new outpatient department attendance at the same hospital or trust that the cases originate from. Controls will be frequency matched on age to 5-year bands (e.g 50.14, 55-59, 60.14, 65-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85+). The overall ratio of cases to controls will be 1:1.  

A control clinic will be randomly selected (from all clinics, not limited to respiratory) at each centre. Paediatric clinics and gynaecological clinics will be excluded. This may be achieved by randomly sampling a list of all clinics, by randomly sampling a list of outpatient locations and a time of the week, or by other means. The central research team will provide support for this activity. 

The local research team will write to the lead clinician for the selected clinic to obtain permission to recruit patients to the study. If permission is refused then the process is repeated until a lead clinician agrees. Once agreement is obtained this clinic will be the source clinic for all controls at that centre for the duration of the study.
 
Potential controls will be invited to participate in the study and provided with a patient information sheet when they attend the outpatient department. Patients will be enrolled into the study, blood will be drawn, the participant will be provided with a job history sheet, and a case-report form will be completed. The case-report form and blood samples will be placed into a pre-paid Royal Mail container and put in a postbox. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked as part of enrolment.

The central research team will be updated monthly with details of the number of eligible patients attending clinic, the number of eligible patients approached to participate in the study, and the number of patients agreeing to participate in the study.

Recruitment of controls from a centre stops when recruitment of cases stops and one control for each case has been recruited or the agreed centre recruitment period ends.

\section{Exposure assessment}

The exposure assessment is carried out by the central research team by means of a computer-assisted telephone intereview.

\section{Introduction}

Hello, my name is \textbf{name of researcher}. I am a doctor/nurse/research assistant calling as part of the IPF Job Exposure Study. Is this \textbf{name of participant}? 

I would like to ask you some questions about the jobs you have had, where you have lived, and smoking. I would also like to record this call for our research if that's ok with you.  

Your answers will help us to understand the causes of IPF, make sure people get the right treatment, and ensure that controls of exposures at work are right so that we protect workers and prevent disease in the future.  

The interview should take about 30 minutes. Is now a good time to talk?

\section{Occupational history} 

I want you to think about all of the jobs you've had. I know this can be hard, we'll try one at a time. 

Do you remember the first job that you had after school?

\begin{enumerate}
\item  What was the name of your job? (we record SOC2000 job title and map SOC90)
\item  What did you do in this job? (we record free text but also have a drop down of activities associated with asbestos exposure)
\item  What was the name of the company (if applicable)? (we record name and SIC code, we possibly link to open corporates company house record)
\item  What did the company make (if applicable)? (we record free text but also have a drop down of asbestos containing products)
\item  In what sort of working area did you spend most of your time? e.g Office, In the Open, Workshop, Construction Site, Factory (Light Industry), Heavy Industry (eg. Power Station), Hospital, School/University, Warehouse, “On Location”, various buildings, Shop, At Home, Ship/Ship yard, Other (specify) 
\item  Did you work full time? (if not specify average hours per week)
\item  Did you work all year round (if not specify months of the year)
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you started the job?
\item  Do you remember how old you were or what year you finished the job?
\item  Do you remember what job you had next?
\end{enumerate}

(1 through 10 repeats until lifetime occupational history is complete. Standard occupational classification is used to code occupations)

Any reported contact with asbestos or `trigger' products (HSE list), industries (construction, factory work, power station work, other heavy industry, ships or ship yards), jobs (see Table ~\ref{table:top15pmr}), and job processes prompts an asbestos exposure history (see later) to be taken.

\section{Venepuncture, sample storage, transportation, and processing} 

Venepuncture will be performed by a qualified practitioner. Sites will be provided with one 10ml EDTA tube and one 10ml SST tube per participant to obtain blood. Samples will be labelled with the participants unique research ID and posted using Royal Mail Safebox to a secure lab storage facility at NHLI where they will be kept in a -80 degree centigrade freezer. Royal Mail Safeboxes will be posted into a royal mail postbox by the local researcher; the hospital postal service will not
be used.
The sender will record the day of delivery and the research team will record receipt of the sample and keep an accurate record of its location. Analysis of samples will include DNA isolation and quantitative PCR taqman assay to investigate pre-defined SNPs of interest.

\section{Unique research IDs}

Each participant will be assigned a unique research ID which will be used to label the Case Report Form and blood tubes. The ID will be 6 digits long. The first 2 digits will be the assigned centre ID. The subsequent 4 digits can be assigned to cases and controls as the centre wishes so long as there are no repeats.

     \item study approvals
     \item study protocol 
     \item study standard operating procedure

 \end{enumerate}


It is acceptable for some or all of these to be stored electronically. At the end of the study the central research team will be responsible for archiving local site files.


\section{Tissue-tracking and communication}

The local team will track tissue obtained from research participants by emailing the central research team with the name and research ID of the research participant to inform them when samples are sent.
